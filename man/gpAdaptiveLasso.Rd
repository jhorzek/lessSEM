\usage{
gpAdaptiveLasso(
  par,
  regularized,
  weights = NULL,
  fn,
  gr = NULL,
  lambdas = NULL,
  nLambdas = NULL,
  additionalArguments = NULL,
  method = "ista",
  control = controlIsta()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{par}{labeled vector with starting values}

\item{regularized}{vector with names of parameters which are to be regularized.}

\item{weights}{labeled vector with adaptive lasso weights. NULL will use 1/abs(par)}

\item{fn}{R function which takes the parameters as input and returns the
fit value (a single value)}

\item{gr}{R function which takes the parameters as input and returns the
gradients of the objective function. If set to NULL, numDeriv will be used
to approximate the gradients}

\item{lambdas}{numeric vector: values for the tuning parameter lambda}

\item{nLambdas}{alternative to lambda: If alpha = 1, lessSEM can automatically
compute the first lambda value which sets all regularized parameters to zero.
It will then generate nLambda values between 0 and the computed lambda.}

\item{additionalArguments}{additional argument passed to fn and gr}

\item{method}{which optimizer should be used? Currently implemented are ista
and glmnet. With ista, the control argument can be used to switch to related procedures
(currently gist).}

\item{control}{used to control the optimizer. This element is generated with
the controlIsta and controlGlmnet functions. See ?controlIsta and ?controlGlmnet
for more details.}
}
\description{
Optimizers in lessSEM can also be used by other packages.
gpAdaptiveLasso allows for combining adaptive lasso regularization and custom fitting functions
with an interface similar to optim.

\examples{
# This example shows how to use the optimizers
# for other objective functions. We will use
# a linear regression as an example. Note that
# this is not a useful application of the optimizers
# as there are specialized packages for linear regression
# (e.g., glmnet)

library(lessSEM)
set.seed(123)

# first, we simulate data for our
# linear regression. The model is given by
# y = b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*x3 + b4*x4 + b5*x5 
n <- 100
df <- data.frame(
  x1 = rnorm(n),
  x2 = rnorm(n),
  x3 = rnorm(n),
  x4 = rnorm(n),
  x5 = rnorm(n)
)
df$y <- 0*df$x1 + .2*df$x2 + .3*df$x3 + .4*df$x4 + .5*df$x5 + rnorm(n,0,.3) 

# First, we must construct a fiting function
# which returns a single value. We will use
# the residual sum squared as fitting function.
# The optimizer expects that this function takes
# EXACTLY three arguments:
# 1) a vector with parameter values (par)
# 2) a vector with labels for these parameters (parameterLabels)
# 3) an additional argument which allows for passing anything
# else your function needs to run to the function.

# Let's start setting up the fitting function:
fittingFunction <- function(par, parameterLabels, additionalArguments){
  # Our function needs the observed data 
  # y and X. These are not part of the first two arguments
  # and must therefore be passed in the function with the 
  # third argument (additionalArguments). Here, we will use a list
  # and pass the arguments in through that list:
  pred <- additionalArguments$X \%*\% matrix(par, ncol = 1)
  sse <- sum((additionalArguments$y - pred)^2)
  return(sse)
}
# Now we need to construct the list additionalArguments used
# by fittingFunction
additionalArguments <- list(X = as.matrix(df[,grepl("x", colnames(df))]), 
                            y = df$y)


# let's define the starting values:
b <- rep(0,5)
names(b) <- paste0("b",1:5)
# names of regularized parameters
regularized <- paste0("b",1:5)

# for our weights, we need the unregularized parameter
# estimates
mle <- coef(lm(y~ 0+., data = df))
weights <- 1/abs(mle)
names(weights) <- paste0("b",1:5)
weights[!names(weights) \%in\% regularized] <- 0

# optimize
alasso <- gpAdaptiveLasso(
  par = b, 
  regularized = regularized, 
  weights = weights,
  fn = fittingFunction, 
  nLambdas = 100, 
  additionalArguments = additionalArguments
)
plot(alasso)
AIC(alasso)
